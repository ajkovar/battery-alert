# Battery Notifier

[It's been shown](https://www.androidauthority.com/maximize-battery-life-882395/) that small but regular top ups to a lithium ion battery (as well as not letting it get too close to either extreme of 0% or 100%) help preserve its lifespan. Currently only supports OSX.

This program will periodically check your battery state and notify you if you need to plug/unplug.

To run:

    runhaskell Main.hs
